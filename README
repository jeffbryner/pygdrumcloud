Dependencies? Hmm: 
pygame
freenect
opengl
numpy
wave
alsaaudio

If you've got a kinect and a reasonable install of python you should be able to just
python pygdrumcloud.py and off ya go. 

The UI has mouse support including scroll wheel for zooming in and out, right mouse for Z axis crazyness, left
mouse to yank the viewport around. 

Important keys: 

ESC	 	quit
keypad + 	Increase the threshold for drawing the back of the cloud (i.e. how much of the room to draw).
keypad -	Decrease the same threshold
-		Decrease the size of the points in the kinect pointcloud
+ (= reall)	Increase the size of the points in the kinect pointcloud
1		Decrease the cloud sample size (helps with slow boxen)
2		Increate the clous sample size (showoff).
space		Sets the viewing parameters back to default.
